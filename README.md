# Legend-Store-Premise
Adventure Game for Introduction to Programming. A non-violent console adventure game created using techniques we have learned so far during the course.

## Game Overview
This is a game about uncovering stories. You play as a small mouse-sized creature that can detect information about an object by touching it. You used to live in the treasure trove of a great hero. Over time you drifted into a deep sleep as the hero stopped coming. You awaken now to find the world is much bigger and a convenience store has been built over the ruins of the hero's trove. In the game, you'll uncover strange artifacts as well as mundane items. If you find the right items you uncover a bigger story.

### Player Goals
There are many endings, currently, there are 2 main ones. With more time though there will be even more to encounter. Players are encouraged to search and uncover secrets in the setting and seek out different endings from the most obvious ones.

### Features
Players can interact with many different items and importantly learn the "Lore" of them. Basically, the stories that each item holds. The lore of some items might comedic, tragic, or anything in between. Perhaps some are even hiding somethings, obscuring more than they reveal.

This is a game about uncovering stories. You play as a small mouse-sized creature that can detect information about an object by touching it. You used to live in the treasure trove of a great hero. Over time you drifted into a deep sleep as the hero stopped coming. You awaken now to find the world is much bigger and a convenience store has been built over the ruins of the hero's trove. In the game, you'll uncover strange artifacts as well as mundane items. If you find the right items you uncover a bigger story.
